# React + Vite


# have developed a React-based ToDo application with additional features, including a login page that does not require backend authentication. The app utilizes local storage for data management, allowing users to log in with any email and password. Users can add, delete, mark tasks as favorite or complete. Additionally, if a task contains keywords like "outdoor," "walk," "run," "hiking," or "park," the application fetches and displays the current weather conditions.
